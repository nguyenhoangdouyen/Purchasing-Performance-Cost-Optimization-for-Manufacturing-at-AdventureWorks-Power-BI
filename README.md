### üìå Key Findings:

#### **1. Total Order, Late Orders and Back Order Rate (%)**
- Total orders peaked in **May‚ÄìJune** (456 orders). Both **Late Orders** and **Back Order Rate** reached their highest in **June‚ÄìJuly (~10.5%)**. Steady decline in these two metrics after August.

-> **Demand peaks mid-year**, causing strain, but ops performance improves clearly in Q4.

#### **2. AVG Purchase Order Cost Trend**
- Average PO cost fluctuated between **$6.3K and $7.8K**. Peaked in **March**, dropped sharply by **October**. The Last Month (LM) line remains stable around **$7.0K‚Äì$7.2K**.

-> PO costs **fluctuate seasonally**, with stronger control toward year-end.

#### **3. Cumulative PO Cost and Cumulative PO Count**
- Cumulative PO Cost steadily increased to **$64M by August**, followed by a sharp drop. This year‚Äôs PO count is significantly lower compared to last year.

-> Likely shift to batch purchasing, **fewer but larger POs**.

#### **4. Top 3 Vendor Pricing vs Market Average Over Time**
- **Chicago City** consistently charges higher than **market average** (~35.5 vs 34.3‚Äì34.7). **SUPERSALES** and **Custom Framers** offer **lower-than-market** pricing with consistent trends.

-> **Heavy spend on higher-cost vendors**, suggesting a strategic choice.

#### **5. Total PO by Month and Category**
- PO volume peaked in **August**, dropped drastically afterward. The **(Blank)** category dominates, while other categories like Accessories and Components are minimal.

-> **Product classification is incomplete**, limiting detailed tracking.

#### **6. Total Purchase Spend by Sub-Category**
- The sub-category **"(Blank)"** represents the **highest total purchase spend ($22M)**, dwarfing all other defined categories. Categories like **Pedals and Tires and Tubes** show substantial spending **($13M each)**, others like **Jerseys, Shorts, Vests, and Bib-Shorts** have considerably **lower spending ($1M or less).**

-> Spending is **concentrated in Pedals, Tires, and large unclassified "(Blank)"** amounts

### üìà II. Product Analysis

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/da07a0f4-da91-4480-9d7d-a9b89e608562)

### üìå Key Findings:

#### **1. Purchase Volume & Average Price**
- Purchase volume peaked during **April‚ÄìAugust** with strong growth, then slightly declined in **October**.
- Meanwhile, the **average purchase price** showed a steady increase from **34.1** to **35.5**, even as volume tapered off.

#### **2. Inventory Turnover**
- **Inventory turnover** reached its highest point in **June‚ÄìJuly** (23K), reflecting strong mid-year demand or movement.
- However, from **September** onward, turnover dropped sharply, indicating slower stock movement.

#### **3. SKUs Below Thresholds**
- Several key SKUs are currently below safety stock thresholds, notably **HL Mountain Frame (145 SKUs)** and **ML Touring Frame (98 SKUs)**.
- This raises the risk of stockouts if demand picks up or new orders surge.

#### **4. Product & Finished Goods Overview**
- Finished goods ratio fluctuates between **33‚Äì47%**, indicating stock imbalance across product groups.
- Some groups show lower finished goods levels, which could impact order fulfillment capability.

#### **5. Total Spend by Product**
- Spending is heavily concentrated on frame lines, with **HL Mountain Frame** leading at **$1.13M**, followed by **ML Touring Frame ($1.01M)**.
- Other product lines show significantly lower total spend.

#### **6. PO & Backorder Rate**
- Although total POs for **Components** are not large, the backorder rate is the highest (**18%**), signaling potential supply gaps from vendors.

#### **7. Inventory Status**
- Many SKUs are currently flagged as **Overstocked**, and the system recommends **Pausing Purchasing** for these items to prevent inventory buildup.

### III. ü§ù Vendor Performance

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/27a04562-6258-4915-bc6a-f7ce96745722)

### üìå Key Findings:

#### **1. PO Cost Variance & Pareto Analysis**
- **Superior Bicycles** leads with **20.6%** of total PO cost variance, indicating a significant impact on purchasing costs.
- The top 5 vendors contribute over **50%** of total variance, showing a high concentration that requires closer cost control.

#### **2. Vendor Spend & Backorder Risk**
- **Superior Bicycles** has the highest spend (**$4.56M**) but also shows a high backorder rate (**20%**).
- **Chicago City Saddles** records the **highest backorder (21.6%)**, signaling a major fulfillment risk.
- In contrast, vendors like **Victory Bikes (11.8%)** and **Inline Accessories (9.8%)** have lower backorder rates, supporting more stable supply.

#### **3. Average PO Cost & Price Trend**
- **Superior Bicycles** also leads in **average PO cost ($45.5K)**, with an upward price trend over the past 6 months.
- Other vendors such as **Inline Accessories ($34.4K)** maintain more stable pricing, helping mitigate price volatility risks.

#### **4. Vendor Segmentation by Spend & Rating**
- **Victory Bikes** and **Proseware, Inc.** are positioned favorably with balanced spend and higher ratings.
- Meanwhile, **Chicago City Saddles** and **Superior Bicycles**, despite their high spend, also carry higher fulfillment risks and need tighter monitoring.

#### **5. Preferred Vendor Pipeline**
- Currently, **91%** of the purchasing pipeline is allocated to **preferred vendors**, ensuring alignment with strategic partners but also requiring close tracking of their performance.

## üîé Final Conclusion & Recommendation 

| **Aspect**                     | **Insight**                                                                                                      | **Recommendation**                                                                                       |
|---------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Order & PO Performance**      | - **Peak demand during May‚ÄìJune** creates significant pressure on operations, with **Late Orders and Back Order Rate** reaching their highest in June‚ÄìJuly (~10.5%). After August, performance improves. | - Improve **order handling during peak seasons** to reduce pressure. <br> - Optimize **processing for at-risk orders**. |
| **PO Cost & Trends**            | - **PO costs fluctuate** throughout the year, peaking in March and dropping sharply by October. Despite fluctuations, PO costs stabilize around $7.0K‚Äì$7.2K by year-end. | - Continue to **control PO costs** tightly, especially at year-end. <br> - **Monitor cost fluctuations** and adjust procurement strategy proactively to avoid sudden cost spikes. |
| **Vendor Performance & Risks**  | - Major suppliers like **Chicago City** and **Superior Bicycles** not only have **high costs** but also present significant **backorder risks**, with backorder rates of **21.6% and 20%** respectively, posing delivery risks. | - **Renegotiate prices** with high-cost suppliers or consider switching suppliers. <br> - Improve delivery processes with high backorder suppliers or reassess suppliers if backorder rates remain high. |
| **Product & Inventory Management** | - **Incomplete product classification** makes it difficult to track spending accurately. The **Blank** product line accounts for the highest spending ($22M), while categories like **Jerseys** and **Vests** show low spending. | - Improve **product classification** for better tracking of spending and to avoid omissions. <br> - Focus on high-spending product lines like **Pedals** and **Tires & Tubes** to optimize resource allocation and purchasing strategy. |
