**Objective:**

**üìñ What is this project about?**

This project analyzes purchasing activities at **AdventureWorks** to support better operational decisions. The Power BI dashboard focuses on:

- **Purchasing Performance**: Monitoring back order rates to ensure timely and sufficient supply for manufacturing needs.  
- **Cost Optimization**: Evaluating average purchase order costs to identify savings opportunities and improve procurement efficiency.


**üë§ Who is this project for?**

This dashboard is designed for key stakeholders involved in the purchasing process at **AdventureWorks**, including:

- **Purchasing Manager**: To monitor supplier performance, order fulfillment, and spot procurement issues early.  
- **Purchasing Executive**: To track purchasing KPIs, ensure compliance with procurement strategies, and manage day-to-day operations efficiently.  
- **Board of Directors (BOD)**: To gain high-level insights into purchasing efficiency and cost control for strategic decision-making.

**‚ùìBusiness Questions:**

- Are we experiencing high back order rates that may impact production timelines?  
- How cost-effective are our purchase orders across different vendors and materials?  
- Which vendors are consistently delivering on time and within budget?  
- Are there any unusual spikes in purchasing cost that need further investigation?  
- How can we improve procurement planning to reduce delays and optimize costs?

### I. Executive Summary

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e35ac020-48b2-4f37-b682-6a92962205b9)

### üìå Key Findings:

#### **1. Total Order, Late Orders and Back Order Rate (%)**

- Total orders peaked in **May‚ÄìJune** (456 orders).
- Both **Late Orders** and **Back Order Rate** reached their highest in **June‚ÄìJuly (~10.5%)**.
- Steady decline in these two metrics after August.

-> Mid-year appears to be a **peak demand period**, stressing the fulfillment system. However, performance **improved significantly in Q4**, indicating better operational control.


#### **2. AVG Purchase Order Cost Trend**

- Average PO cost fluctuated between **$6.3K and $7.8K**.
- Peaked in **March**, dropped sharply by **October**.
- The Last Month (LM) line remains stable around **$7.0K‚Äì$7.2K**.

-> PO costs show **seasonal fluctuations**, suggesting **stronger cost control or supplier negotiations** toward the end of the year.


#### **3. Cumulative PO Cost and Cumulative PO Count**

- Cumulative PO Cost steadily increased to **$64M by August**, followed by a sharp drop.
- This year‚Äôs PO count is significantly lower compared to last year.

-> Indicates a **batch purchasing strategy** or increased **PO efficiency**, reducing frequency while maintaining volume.


#### **4. Top 3 Vendor Pricing vs Market Average Over Time**

- **Chicago City** consistently charges higher than **market average** (~35.5 vs 34.3‚Äì34.7).
- **SUPERSALES** and **Custom Framing** offer **lower-than-market** pricing with consistent trends.

-> Heavy reliance on **higher-cost vendors** may impact purchasing efficiency unless there‚Äôs a **strategic reason** (e.g. quality, lead time).


#### **5. Total PO by Month and Category**

- PO volume peaked in **August**, dropped drastically afterward.
- The **(Blank)** category dominates, while other categories like Accessories and Components are minimal.

-> Product classification is likely **incomplete or inconsistent**, which can **limit granular tracking and analysis** by category.


#### **6. Total Purchase Spend by Sub-Category**

- The sub-category **"(Blank)"** represents the **highest total purchase spend ($22M)**, dwarfing all other defined categories.
- Categories like **Pedals and Tires and Tubes** show substantial spending **($13M each)**, others like **Jerseys, Shorts, Vests, and Bib-Shorts** have considerably **lower spending ($1M or less).
-> Spending heavily concentrated in **Pedals and Tires**, suggesting a focus that warrants further demand/sourcing review. Large "(Blank)" spending obscures understanding of where funds are truly allocated.
